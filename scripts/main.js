// Problem #1 - Create a "Hello World" program

// let username = prompt("What is your name?");
// console.log(`Hello, ${username}, nice to meet you!`);
// ---------- The above problem is commented because there is an alert which will pop up every time we refresh the page

// Problem #2 -
// Create a program that prompts for an input string and displays output that shows the input string and the number of characters the string contains.

// let string = prompt("Write anything that you want to", "Example String");
let string = "Hello, this is the example string.";
console.log(string);
console.log(`"${string}" has ${string.length} characters.`);
